# Sleeping-Barber

This project was done for the OS lesson.

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>A barber shop has a waiting room with n chairs and m barber cushions. If there are no customers waiting at the end, the barber goes to sleep and does not expect the customers to be shaved by other barbers. If all the chairs are full and a customer comes in, the customer leaves the hall because the hall is full. If the barber is shaving someone at that time but there is an empty chair, the person entering will sit on one of the empty chairs. If a customer enters while the barber is sleeping, the customer awakens the barber.</p>
